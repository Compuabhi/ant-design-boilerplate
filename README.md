# ES6 React Ant Design boilerplate using Webpack

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/KleoPetroff/react-webpack-boilerplate/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/espinacs/ant-design-boilerplate) 

Just and example of ant-design working in React 16: 


## Starting the dev server

Make sure you have the latest Stable or LTS version of Node.js installed.

1. `git clone https://github.com/espinacs/ant-design-boilerplate`
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the dev server using `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Available Commands

- `npm start` - start the dev server
- `npm clean` - delete the dist folder
- `npm run production` - create a production ready build in `dist` folder
- `npm run lint` - execute an eslint check
- `npm test` - run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in watch mode
- `npm run coverage` - generate code coverage report in the `coverage` folder

Also, precommit and prepush are both enabled to check all the code is linted and tested.

## About the architecture

Although this application is really simple (just fetch data, list and filter it) it has a pretty complete architecture, as detailed:

#### REACT - View Rendering

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is just the way to display the stored info. Mainly, there's a Main container that dispatches both fetch and filtering events, and at the same times renders the SearchBar (self component) and the Ant Desing Table

#### REDUX-SAGA - Fetching Data

[Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) is the agent dedicated to fetch data from the server, and dispatches the convenient Redux events with fetched data or errors.

This is only a layer that could be changed, for example, by an Apollo GraphQL interface.

#### REDUX - State Management

[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) stores part of the state of the application (a part from the one that each component/containers handles for itself).

#### RESELECT - Serving Data

Components are not subscribed directly to the Redux state. Instead, they only get data from the Redux state through [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) selectors.

This way, components/containers and redux are absolutely decoupled, and any other State Manager (Flux, for example) could be used, like any other components library (Vue.js, for example)

#### Ant Design - Stlyed Components Library

[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) Gives to the project a small style boost!

## Code Coverage

The project is using the Jest Code Coverage tool. The reports are generated by running `npm run coverage`. All configurations are located in `package.json`, inside the `jest` object.

The coverage report consists of an HTML reporter, which can be viewed in the browser and some helper coverage files like the coverage json and xml file.

## Production code

Run `npm run production`. The production-ready code will be located under `dist` folder.

## Licence

_ant-design-boilerplate_ is available under MIT.
